                                                    The project aimed to simulate communication methods in natural disaster zones, requiring us to develop Python scripts to convert messages into Morse code signals. Additionally, we constructed an antenna for receiving and deciphering Morse code signals transmitted by another group. This interdisciplinary challenge tested my understanding of the Fourier Transform for signal processing and honed my programming skills in Python.

                                                    Navigating this project presented several challenges, including ensuring the accuracy and reliability of our Morse code conversion scripts and optimizing antenna design for effective signal reception. Overcoming these challenges involved rigorous testing, iterative improvements, and collaborative problem-solving among team members with diverse backgrounds in engineering and programming.

                                                    Through this experience, I gained a deeper appreciation for the practical applications of theoretical concepts like the Fourier Transform in real-world scenarios. It reinforced the importance of interdisciplinary collaboration and adaptability in overcoming technical challenges, preparing me for future projects that require innovative solutions at the intersection of engineering and communication technologies.

                            <p class="projects__decription">
                            Participating the 2024 Al Worden Endeavour Challenge was a transformative experience. 
                            My team and I were tasked with planning a mission to Proxima Centauri, designing a spacecraft capable of long-distance travel and accommodating human needs.
                            This involved extensive research and collaboration, enhancing our teamwork and problem-solving skills.
                            There were challenges during the planning part of the competiton as we were not able to physically meet other, resulting in slow progres initially.
                            However, we were able to overcome it as we coordinate and delegated task to each other, making sure everyone was responsible in finishing thier part.
                            On competition day, the whole team extremely nervous and felt under prepared, however we were confident that we could pull it off as we had prepared for it and supported each other. 
                            Overcoming these obstacles required effective communication, quick thinking, and leveraging our collective expertise. 
                            We had to adapt rapidly to unexpected problems, demonstrating resilience and resourcefulness. 
                            The experience taught us the importance of clear communication, delegation of tasks, and maintaining a calm, focused approach under pressure.
                            Through this project, I honed my skills in project management, technical design, and interdisciplinary cooperation. 
                            I gained a deeper understanding of space travel logistics, life support systems, and the psychological, social, and ethical considerations of long-duration missions.

                                Participating in the Perse Coding Team Challenge Competition offered my teammate and I an exciting opportunity to tackle complex coding problems in a competitive environment. 
                                The competition required collaborative problem-solving, where each team member's strengths contributed to quicking solving problems under time constraints. 
                                Through this experience, I enhanced my teamwork and communication skills as I had to be concise when sharing information, learning to coordinate effectively with people. 
                                My background in computing provided a foundation for understanding the algorithms, enabling me to contribute to the team’s 
                                success and adapt to the dynamic challenges presented during the competition.

                            Participating in an international humanities symposium was a deeply enriching experience. 
                            We represented our schools service learning board and shared about service learning during the symposium
                            Although we only received a participation award, the experience was invaluable.
                            The symposium highlighted the importance of humanities in understanding and addressing societal challenges. It also allowed me to connect the humanities with engineering science, emphasizing the need for interdisciplinary knowledge in holistic problem-solving and innovation.
                            This event deepened my awareness of social issues and reinforced the value of a human-centered approach in engineering, preparing me to develop socially responsible solutions.

                                We perfomaned 2 songs by Micheal Jackson. The theme of this perfomance was about rebellion.Our performance included two chosen songs and a set piece for the year, featuring intricate prop designs that I contributed to using my engineering skills. Despite the intense preparation and competition pressure, we delivered a memorable performance.

                                This experience highlighted the intersection of music and engineering, particularly in prop making. My technical knowledge and problem-solving abilities were crucial in designing and constructing props that enhanced our stage presence and storytelling. It showcased how engineering skills can creatively contribute to artistic endeavors, underscoring the value of interdisciplinary collaboration in achieving successful performances.
